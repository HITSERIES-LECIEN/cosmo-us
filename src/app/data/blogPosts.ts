          "The answer is not more color—it is clearer structure. Historical waistcoats and tailored panels show the same grammar again and again: dense sprays that rise from openings—plackets, buttonholes, pocket flaps—thin punctuation across open fields, and borders that frame the eye without crowding it.",
          "COSMO® No. 25 Embroidery Floss—extra-long staple cotton in over 500 solids, with a polished soft sheen—is built for that kind of control. Separate strands for fine stems; keep fuller strands for satin petals that catch light effectively off a dark weave.",

          "Think of the fabric as your darkest “thread.” Then choose a short solid palette—often 5–8 colors—that climbs clearly above that floor. A quick check: lay candidate skeins on the dark cloth and photograph them in grayscale on your phone—if a color disappears in black-and-white, it lacks the value contrast to pop.",
